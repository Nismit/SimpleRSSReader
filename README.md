# Simple RSS Reader

Super Simple RSS Reader

This is a super simple rss reader, but it still on working unfortunately.
Now, it's hard cording, you can not set URLs..
if you pull listview, it will load and get another data.
I did make XML Parser, you can fetch RSS 2.0/Atom feeds.

Features:
- One Activity
- Uses Fragments
- Observer with AsyncTask
- HTTP Client
- XML Parser
- Custom ListView
- SwipeRefreshLayout
- Clearly directories

Future Plan:
It will be using database and will be saved your feed urls.
If you touch the listview, it will be shown web view or send service to browser.
